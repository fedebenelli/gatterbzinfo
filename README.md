This is a work in progress program, that will gatter all the data from different ODF files form Battlezone and then generate json and xlsx files with the gattered data. 
As for now, the gatter of data for ordinances and guns is fully automated, but still some polish needs to be done since the result file is kinda messy. Since it's better standarized, vehicle data is easier to gatter right now I'm not familiar with BZ2/BZCC ODF files, but I guess they have similar format so it could be used there, too
